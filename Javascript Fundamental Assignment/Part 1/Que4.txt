In JavaScript, **operator precedence** determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. For example, in the expression `5 + 3 * 2`, the multiplication operator (`*`) has a higher precedence than the addition operator (`+`), so `3 * 2` is evaluated first, and then the result is added to `5`, resulting in `11`.

In addition to precedence, **associativity** also plays a role in determining the order of evaluation of operators with the same precedence. Associativity determines whether operators are evaluated from left to right or from right to left. For example, the addition operator (`+`) is left-associative, which means that in the expression `5 + 3 + 2`, the leftmost `+` is evaluated first, resulting in `8`, and then the result is added to `2`, resulting in `10`.

It is important to understand operator precedence and associativity in JavaScript because it can affect the outcome of expressions. If you don't understand these concepts, you may end up with unexpected results. For example, in the expression `5 + 3 * 2`, if you don't understand operator precedence, you might expect the result to be `16` instead of `11`
