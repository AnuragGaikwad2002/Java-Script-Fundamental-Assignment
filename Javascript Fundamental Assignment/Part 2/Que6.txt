Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is important because it makes your code more readable and easier to understand. For example, instead of using a variable name like `x`, you could use a more descriptive name like `numberOfStudents`. This makes it clear what the variable represents and makes the code easier to read. Here is an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability:

```
// Without a clear identifier
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;

// With a clear identifier
let numberOfStudents = 5;
let numberOfTeachers = 10;
let totalPeople = numberOfStudents + numberOfTeachers;
```

In this example, using clear identifiers like `numberOfStudents` and `numberOfTeachers` makes it clear what the variables represent and makes the code easier to read.
